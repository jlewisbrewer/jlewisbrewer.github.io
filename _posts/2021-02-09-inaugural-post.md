The day has come: I've launched my website. I was relunctant to do this for quite some time because I thought it would be more painful than it was. Luckily [Github](https://github.com) and [Jekyll minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) have made the experience almost painless. This site is still very much a work in progress but this is A Pretty Good Beginning.

So what's the plan? At the moment, I am using this site to showcase my various projects, but I also have some ideas about writing some tech relevant posts. Additionally, I want to record what books I have read for both the sake of posterity and to better absorb what I am reading.

For now though, feel free to check out some of my projects and github!
