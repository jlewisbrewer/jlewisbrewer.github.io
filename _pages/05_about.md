# About me

Hi, my name is Jason Brewer. I am a recent Master's graduate of Computer Science and love dreaming up new projects and working on them. I have a deep passion for learning and am constantly improving myself by studying new tools and technologies. When I'm not busy working on my never-ending project ideas, I can be found reading or perusing [wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org) etymologies. My other hobbies include gaming, biking, and feeding the cat.

# About Saevandill

Saevandill is an Old Norse word I may have coined. It (hopefully) means <em>sea wanderer</em>. I created this word based on analogy with the name [Aurvandill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurvandill), a figure from Norse mythology. I chose the word Saevandill for this site for two reasons: the first because it a reflection of me. Its form exemplifies my preoccupation with obscure legomena and my love of playful wordcraft. The word itself is a compound of <em>sae</em> and <em>vandill</em>. <em>Sae</em> is sea. I been drawn to the sea my whole life - I was once a Navyman, and, barring a handful of years, have always lived close to some coast. I am still attracted to the sea and have developed an armchair interest for sailing that I hope to one day realize. The other compound, <em>vandill</em>, I have liberally translated as wanderer. The root of wander is <em>wend</em>, a lovely old word that sounds archaic these days, but is still well seen as the past tense of go. To wend originally meant something like <em>to turn</em> or <em>to change</em>, but, even in older times, it had a wide range of connotations. I quite like the modern connotation of wander - <em>to go somewhere indirectly</em>, <em>to roam, travel</em>. I think this aptly describes my worldy forays - sometimes I don't have a direction in mind but am always rewarded the journey.

The second reason I chose this word is because it describes this site. I want to use it as a vessel that tracks my wanderings over these ever deepening and widening seas of inquiry and knowledge. I want to record my projects and ramblings and memories, so I can not only marvel at my course but also share it with you, my dear reader.
